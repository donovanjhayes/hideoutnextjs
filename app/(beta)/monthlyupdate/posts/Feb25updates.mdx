## Quick Updates
- New format for the updates to make it easier to read and navigate (still working on getting it online)
- No update from the lawsuit
- Bookings at the Chalet have been slow, but we have some lined up for the summer
- Link to the 2025 budget spreadsheet is provided below
- Reserves are dipping lower due to low bookings and high heat costs for the winter

## More Detailed Updates (as needed) 
- None this month

## Things on the Horizon
- Some time in spring/summer we should have another business meeting to discuss who pays what and when, look at the values of the houses, and make adjustments and reevaluate commitments and agreements. (spring/summer so we can know what is happening with the lawsuit and the USA in general)
